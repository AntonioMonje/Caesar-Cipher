# Caesar-Cipher
This program takes in a string and moves each letter over by a specified amount given as an argument. any other characters and spaces stay the same.
The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.
